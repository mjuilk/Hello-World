                Projects are difficult. Trust me, we know. College projects, content creation, research, lessons plans for teachers,
                or even simply planning out your future. 
                <br>
                When you look up at these mountains, it can be daunting. So make it Klein.
                <br>
                Your mountains don't have to be impossible. They can be that, just mountains, and mountains are climbable.
                <br>

                Even Everest is up there, but hey, we believe in you.

                Don't forget about that rundown! 
                <br>
                Break this down more! 
                <br>
                Why is this still here? 
                <br>
                Take a breath, look to the future, and ask yourself: what do I want to do. What do I really want to do? 
                <br>
                Once you've established your goal, Klein helps you build a plan and easily map out the smaller steps you need to
                achieve your goal. 
                <br>
                Keep track of what each step consists of, remind yourself how much time you've put
                into your work, and <strong><em>always stay focused.</em></strong>
